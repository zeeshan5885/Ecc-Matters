* This is the original code written by Dan, we may want to run it if need only mass distribution without ecccentricity and spin.
* The method is same as defined in home page of this repo's README.md file. But you need the **scaled_events** instead of **weighted_evetns**. So, go the the population-genrator directory and move the genrated scaled_events into the syn_events directory here.

```
cp *.dat ~/.../syn_events
```
